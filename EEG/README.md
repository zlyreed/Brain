- Different EEG wave patterns ([frequency bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)):


Band | Frequncy (Hz) |
--- | --- | 
Delta | <4 | 
Theta | >=4 an <8  | 
Alpha | >=8 and <14  | 
Beta | >=14  | 

Note: Unfortunately there is no agreement in standard reference works on what these ranges should be...
