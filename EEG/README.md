# The Basics on EEG

- Definitions

- EEG 10-20 system:

- Different EEG wave patterns ([frequency bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)):


Band | Frequncy (Hz) |
--- | --- | 
Delta | <4 | 
Theta | 4-7  | 
Alpha | 8-15  | 
Beta | 16-31 | 
Gamma | >32 | 
Mu | 8-12 | 

Note: Unfortunately there is no agreement in standard reference works on what these ranges should be...

# Others:
- **Questions from IRB:** 
1. Some references cite a risk of EEG-induced seizures.  Please clarify this and consider revising the statement that EEG and fNIRS “will not cause any harmful effects to the subjects.”
   - [What are the risks of an EEG?](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/neurological/electroencephalogram_eeg_92,P07655)
   - [3 EEG Activation Procedures Used to Induce Seizures](http://www.rscdiagnosticservices.com/blog/three-eeg-activation-procedures-used-to-induce-seizures-in-eegs)
   
2. Since the study involves collecting physiological/clinical data, such as EEG and fNIRS, it is recommended that a qualified medical doctor be included on the research team. Since these data may be indicative of potential medical abnormalities, such as epilepsy, sleep disorder, brain tumor, stroke, and mental disorders, a trained medical doctor would be better prepared to deal with any contingencies.
