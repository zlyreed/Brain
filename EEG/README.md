- Different EEG wave patterns ([frequency bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)):


Band | Frequncy (Hz) |
--- | --- | 
Delta | <4 | 
Theta | 4-7  | 
Alpha | 8-15  | 
Beta | 16-31 | 
Gamma | >32 | 
Mu | 8-12 | 

Note: Unfortunately there is no agreement in standard reference works on what these ranges should be...
