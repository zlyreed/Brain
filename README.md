# Nervous system
  - In vertebrates it consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). ([by wikipeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system))

# Brain Functions
  - **Motor Cortex**
    - The motor cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex involved in the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements. Classically the motor cortex is an area of the frontal lobe located in the posterior precentral gyrus immediately anterior to the central sulcus.  ([by wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex))    
	  
	  ![mortor_cortex](/pics/250px-Human_motor_cortex.jpg)  

	  - The motor cortex can be divided into three areas: 
	    - The _primary motor cortex_ is the main contributor to generating neural impulses that pass down to the spinal cord and control the execution of movement. However, some of the other motor areas in the brain also play a role in this function. It is located on the anterior paracentral lobule on the medial surface. 
        - The _premotor cortex_ is responsible for some aspects of motor control, possibly including the preparation for movement, the sensory guidance of movement, the spatial guidance of reaching, or the direct control of some movements with an emphasis on control of proximal and trunk muscles of the body. Located anterior to the primary motor cortex. 
        - The _supplementary motor area (or SMA)_, has many proposed functions including the internally generated planning of movement, the planning of sequences of movement, and the coordination of the two sides of the body such as in bi-manual coordination. Located on the midline surface of the hemisphere anterior to the primary motor cortex. 
          - The _posterior parietal cortex_ is sometimes also considered to be part of the group of motor cortical areas; however it is best to regard it as an association cortex rather than motor. It is thought to be responsible for transforming multisensory information into motor commands, and to be responsible for some aspects of motor planning, in addition to many other functions that may not be motor related.
          - The _primary somatosensory cortex_, especially the part called area 3a, which lies directly against the motor cortex, is sometimes considered to be functionally part of the motor control circuitry.
        - Other brain regions outside the cerebral cortex are also of great importance to motor function, most notably the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, pedunculopontine nucleus and the red nucleus, as well as other subcortical motor nuclei.

  - **Prefrontal cortex**
    - functions: 
      - The most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social "control" (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes). [(by wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex)
      - The prefrontal cortex is a cortical area located in the anterior frontal lobe, including several subdivisions (e.g. ventromedial, dorsolateral, orbitofrontal cortices). The prefrontal cortex functions in cognitive control (e.g. planning, attention, problem-solving, error-monitoring, decision-making, social cognition, and working memory).

	  - Anatomy: the dlPFC is a neocortical brain region, meaning it is part of the outer "cortex" (Latin: "bark" or "rind") of the brain. More generally, it's part of the "prefrontal cortex", which are the brain regions anterior (forward) from the motor parts of the frontal lobes. 
	  - Here's a quick overview of how the dlPFC relates to topics in the peer-reviewed literature, according to brainSCANr:

      - It is in charge of executive function, decision making and planning, predicting, and plays a role in holding short term/working memory.

	  - In brain-imaging studies using PETscans, depressed people display abnormally low activity in the prefrontalcortex, and more specifically in its lateral, orbitofrontal,and ventromedial regions.And the severity of the depression often correlates with the extentof the decline in activity in the prefrontal cortex.

	    - use 64-channel EEG
		- Introduction: The motor preparation in those types of complex tasks relies not only on the engagement of the premotor cortex and motor areas, but alsoon the parietal areas,the orbitomedial and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [8,9,10,11,12]. 
		- The participation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)on motor preparation and execution has been interpreted as a compensatory activity improving response accuracy in the control of complex or difficult actions. In older adults, PFC control becomes progressively stronger and is associated with a slower response time, though response accuracy remains high [13].
        - Furthermore, a physically active lifestyle appears to counteract PFC over-recruitment during action preparation and to preserve fast response times, especially after 35â€“40 years of age [12]. The PFC is the highest stage of neural integration in the perceptionaction cycle, which allow us successive interaction with the environment in the goals pursuit, playing also a critical role in working memory, future planning and action monitoring. Once the goal is reached, the PFC sends feedback to posterior associative areas. 
		- In other words, the PFC coordinates cognitive functions in the temporal organization of behavior, that is the creation of coherent behavioral sequences toward the goal. All the prefrontal functions might be defined pre-adaptive, because they pre-adapt the individual to a future predicted environment [14].

	   - use PortaLite fNIRS (Artinis) at left and right Brodmann's areas 10--the dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal cortex (prefrontal cortex).[41,42]
	   - The neural control of dual-task (DT) walking and obstacle negotiation is mediated by various regions in the brain, among them the frontal lobe. The frontal cortex, and specifically the prefrontal cortex and its related circuits, are involved in dual tasking and have been implicated in planning, organization, execution, and adjustment to the environment of walking.[25,26]
