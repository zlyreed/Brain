    - planning movements: forward potion of the frontal lobe (area 6: ship's captain)
	- controlling movements: praimary morto cortex (area 4: ship's lieutenants)
	
  - What are the primary functions of the [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex](https://www.quora.com/Neuroanatomy-What-are-the-primary-functions-of-the-dorsolateral-prefrontal-cortex)? (by Bradley Voytek, UCSD)

	- Anatomy: the dlPFC is a neocortical brain region, meaning it is part of the outer "cortex" (Latin: "bark" or "rind") of the brain. More generally, it's part of the "prefrontal cortex", which are the brain regions anterior (forward) from the motor parts of the frontal lobes. 
    - Here's a quick overview of how the dlPFC relates to topics in the peer-reviewed literature, according to brainSCANr:
