# Functions of different brain regions 
  - **Motor Cortex**
    - The motor cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex involved in the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements. Classically the motor cortex is an area of the frontal lobe located in the posterior precentral gyrus immediately anterior to the central sulcus.  ([by wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex))

	  - The motor cortex can be divided into three areas: 
	    - The primary motor cortex is the main contributor to generating neural impulses that pass down to the spinal cord and control the execution of movement. However, some of the other motor areas in the brain also play a role in this function. It is located on the anterior paracentral lobule on the medial surface. 
        - The premotor cortex is responsible for some aspects of motor control, possibly including the preparation for movement, the sensory guidance of movement, the spatial guidance of reaching, or the direct control of some movements with an emphasis on control of proximal and trunk muscles of the body. Located anterior to the primary motor cortex. 
        - The supplementary motor area (or SMA), has many proposed functions including the internally generated planning of movement, the planning of sequences of movement, and the coordination of the two sides of the body such as in bi-manual coordination. Located on the midline surface of the hemisphere anterior to the primary motor cortex. 
          - The posterior parietal cortex is sometimes also considered to be part of the group of motor cortical areas; however it is best to regard it as an association cortex rather than motor. It is thought to be responsible for transforming multisensory information into motor commands, and to be responsible for some aspects of motor planning, in addition to many other functions that may not be motor related.
          - The primary somatosensory cortex, especially the part called area 3a, which lies directly against the motor cortex, is sometimes considered to be functionally part of the motor control circuitry.
        - Other brain regions outside the cerebral cortex are also of great importance to motor function, most notably the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, pedunculopontine nucleus and the red nucleus, as well as other subcortical motor nuclei.

	 - controlling movements: praimary morto cortex (area 4: ship's lieutenants)

  - **Prefrontal cortex**
    -The prefrontal cortex is a cortical area located in the anterior frontal lobe, including several subdivisions (e.g. ventromedial, dorsolateral, orbitofrontal cortices). The prefrontal cortex functions in cognitive control (e.g. planning, attention, problem-solving, error-monitoring, decision-making, social cognition, and working memory).

	  - Anatomy: the dlPFC is a neocortical brain region, meaning it is part of the outer "cortex" (Latin: "bark" or "rind") of the brain. More generally, it's part of the "prefrontal cortex", which are the brain regions anterior (forward) from the motor parts of the frontal lobes. 
	  - Here's a quick overview of how the dlPFC relates to topics in the peer-reviewed literature, according to brainSCANr:

      - It is in charge of executive function, decision making and planning, predicting, and plays a role in holding short term/working memory.

	  - In brain-imaging studies using PETscans, depressed people display abnormally low activity in the prefrontalcortex, and more specifically in its lateral, orbitofrontal,and ventromedial regions.And the severity of the depression often correlates with the extentof the decline in activity in the prefrontal cortex.
