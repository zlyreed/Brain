## NIRS, [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared_spectroscopy)
- [Subudhi, et al., 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19150853), Frontal and motor cortex oxygenation during maximal exercise in normoxia and hypoxia.
  - A multichannel NIRS instrument (Oxymon III,Artinis) emitting continuous wavelengths of 780- and 850-nm light was used to monitor changes in oxygenated (O2Hb), deoxygenated (HHb), and total (THb) cerebral and muscle heme concentrations
  - Concentration changes in O2Hb and HHb were calculated using the modified Beer-Lambert law and differential pathlength factors of 5.93 for cerebral and 4.95 for muscle tissue (6, 31). 
  - THb was calculated as the sum of O2Hb and HHb.
